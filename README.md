# RISC-V Processor Project

This project contains a RISC-V processor implemented in VHDL, along with a Python simulation script. For users looking for an interactive simulation environment, a web-based simulator is also available.

## Project Structure

- **`Rstruction`**: Contains VHDL files for the RISC-V processor implementation, which currently supports **R, I, and L** instruction types. Support for **B, S, and J** types is planned for future updates. The processor was developed using Quartus.

- **`Verifython`**: A Python script designed to simulate individual RISC-V instructions for testing purposes. 

- **Online Simulator**: For full-featured RISC-V simulation, use the [RISC-V Processor Simulation website](https://matthiasgermain.github.io/RISC-V-Processor/), which provides an interactive environment for running instructions and viewing the results.
